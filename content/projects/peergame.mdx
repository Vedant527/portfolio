Created a game-sharing service with Node.js, PeerJS, and WebRTC. The service enables users to join a peer-to-peer network, taking on roles as players or game sharers. Notably, players can remotely engage in gameplay on sharers' computers, achieving latency levels below 100 milliseconds. Implemented a recommendation server via Flask, utilizing user interactions to suggest games tailored to individual preferences.
