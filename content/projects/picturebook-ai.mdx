In a dynamic 36-hour hackathon hosted by AI ATL, my teammates, Sid Pilai and Rajit Khanna, and I spearheaded the creation of an innovative application, "Picturebook.ai," which transforms written narratives into engaging picture books. Our project clinched the first-place title for the best use of Streamlit by Snowflake, and we demoed it at the SX Summit. Our goal was to allow younger children to develop an interest at a younger age by converting complex, descriptive written books into picture books that are more comprehensible.
