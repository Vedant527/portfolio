As part of my SWE Internship on Fiserv's debit routing team, I developed a JavaFX simulation routing UI in the Debit Routing Systems team, reducing developers' route implementation time to 10 minutes. Implemented Socket Programming for real-time server communication and established a persistent system for seamless access to previous states.
