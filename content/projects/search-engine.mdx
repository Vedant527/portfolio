Designed and implemented a focused web crawler and search engine in Python, customized for indexing and navigating diverse Georgia Tech websites. Integrated NLP techniques, including cosine similarity and TFIDF, to enhance search accuracy and relevance. Through meticulous crawling of web pages, the system ensures efficient retrieval of precise information, addressing the nuanced requirements of users within the Georgia Tech digital environment. Within an hour, the crawler successfully crawled, indexed, and stored (in MongoDB) over 5,000 pages.
