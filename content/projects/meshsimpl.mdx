Implemented various subdivision algorithms, including loop and butterfly subdivision, commonly employed in 3D graphics. Strategically integrated these algorithms to optimize the rendering process for complex scenes. Improved visual quality by incorporating the Laplacian smoothing algorithm, enhancing the portrayal of curved shapes within scenes. Resulted in a more sophisticated and aesthetically pleasing scene.
