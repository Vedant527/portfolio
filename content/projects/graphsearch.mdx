Imported OSM data and converted it into a networkx graph in python, and then implemented soa graph search algorithms including Bi-directional A*, UCS and tri-directional A*, UCS. Accelerated performance by using advanced techniques like the ALT algorithm (using landmarks and triangle inequality) and modified heuristics.
