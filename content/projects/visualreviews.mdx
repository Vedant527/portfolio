As an SDE Intern at Amazon, I developed the Visual Review Generator API to assist the Automated Media Production team in quickly creating Visual Reviews. These reviews consist of SVG images that pair a product image with its corresponding review. By enabling the team to generate Visual Reviews in less than 2 seconds, the API significantly reduced the reliance on expensive third-party graphic designers, contributing to enhanced efficiency and cost savings. This initiative played a key role in supporting the team's goal of scaling content output by 10x each month for the launch of "Shop by Interest."
